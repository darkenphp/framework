# Darken

A PHP framework with a twist—think Nuxt.js and Astro had a PHP baby, but without the node_modules drama, npm meltdowns, or yarn tantrums. Composer? We’re cool with that; it’s the classy uncle we all respect. We’ve got components with slots (because who doesn’t love a good slot?), and every method, property, and class is IDE auto-completion-friendly—no guessing games here!

Auto-magic? Nope, we’re not wizards. Darken needs to compile while you work your magic or at least once before you hit deploy. Oh, and when you create a new project, you won’t be greeted by a junk drawer of files and folders—just the bare essentials, like a tidy minimalist's dream.
